<Building_Shield_Fortress.description>By refocusing the primary coil system into a vertical configuration the shields range can be extended, while lacking the flexability of the Fire Supression mode it does cover a large area and gain the ability to disrupt the avionic systems of DropPods, caulsing failure of their decent rockets and therefore a terminal velocity impact.</Building_Shield_Fortress.description>

<Building_ShieldSIF.description>Rather than creating a large circular shield this generator will create an small individual shield over each wall/door object.</Building_ShieldSIF.description>
