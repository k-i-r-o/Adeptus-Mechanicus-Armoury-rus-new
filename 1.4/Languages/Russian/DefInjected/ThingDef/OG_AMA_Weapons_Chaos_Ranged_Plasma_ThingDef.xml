The Plasma Pistol is most commonly carried by champions of both the Chaos Space Marines and Traitor Guardsmen.
Like other Human infantry-carried plasma weapons, Plasma Pistols are more powerful than plasma weapons used by xenos races but far more unstable as they have a chance to malfunction and explode, wounding or even killing the wielder.

The Traitor Legions have long made use of larger plasma weapons containing hydrogen fuel in a higher quantum state, making them both more powerful and more dangerous to wield. -->
