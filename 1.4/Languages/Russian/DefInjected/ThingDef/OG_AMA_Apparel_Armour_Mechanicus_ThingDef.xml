They view themselves as engineer-mystics dedicated to the Omnissiah, and each Enginseer possesses a wealth of knowledge on how to maintain and repair mechanical and electronic technology. Unlike most of the Priesthood of the Adeptus Mechanicus, Enginseers can be found serving in almost every Imperial institution (other than the Adeptus Astartes, where the same role is played by the Techmarines), and are often assigned to regiments of the Imperial Guard or other parts of the Adeptus Terra. Enginseers are highly-trained members of the Cult Mechanicus and are dedicated to the maintenance of Imperial technology. -->

Reticules and calibrators pick out targets with uncanny accuracy, Galvanic Rifles bark and Servitor-bullets find the skulls of the foe.
