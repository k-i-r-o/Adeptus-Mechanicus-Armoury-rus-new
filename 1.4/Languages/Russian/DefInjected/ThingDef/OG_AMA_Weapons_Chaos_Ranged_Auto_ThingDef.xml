Cheap, rugged and reliable, it can be found throughout the Imperium, where it is appreciated for its decent damage and accuracy. Its main drawbacks are its weight and the need to carry a large amount of cumbersome ammunition for prolonged operations. The latter drawback has led to the Astra Militarum being equipped with Lasguns as its standard armament since the early 32nd Millennium. Xenos races such as the brutal Orks are known to take particular relish in using several of their own crude versions of these formidable automatic weapons, known as Sluggas, Shootas and Snazzguns. -->

The Reaper Autocannon was originally designed during the Great Crusade for use as a heavy support weapon for the Terminator Squads of the Space Marine Legions. The weapon features two barrels and is capable of a high rate of fire, but it requires the incredible strength available to those who wear Terminator Armour to be carried as an infantry-portable weapon. This is because the recoil of this weapon is too great for even Power Armour-wearing Space Marines to unleash it effectively. The weapon usually features a large blade on the end of the barrels that can be used in close combat if needed. -->

It is a medium calibre rotary Autocannon, with its 6 barrels cycled by an electric motor past a single chamber. The Assault Cannon was developed after the end of the Horus Heresy in the early 31st Millennium as a replacement for the Autocannon. Introduced during the Mark IIIA phase of Indomitus Pattern Terminator Armour development, this weapon is the standard alternative to the Heavy Flamer as a Terminator Squad's special ranged weapon. Its design has changed little in 10 Terran millennia, retaining the distinctively long, cylindrical, rotating barrels. Although it lacks the range of the Autocannon and many other Imperial heavy weapons, the Assault Cannon is a fearsome weapon when used at the close range role from which it was intended to be fired. -->
