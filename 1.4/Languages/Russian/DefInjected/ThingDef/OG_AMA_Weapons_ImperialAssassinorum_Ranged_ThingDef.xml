Like its cousin the Exitus Rifle, it is a masterpiece of Adeptus Mechanicus engineering and is custom-built for the requirements of the individual assassin. The Pistol is largely a backup weapon for the Exitus Rifle and is used in the rare circumstances the assassin is discovered, cornered, or in need of rapid-fire weaponry. With a built-in silencer and capable of penetrating most armor with ease, it is has saved the lives of many Vindicare Assassins. Like its rifle counterpart, the Exitus Pistol is capable of firing a variety of specialized ammunition. These include:
Shield-Breaker Rounds - Overload the personal Force Fields of the target.
Turbo-Penetrator Rounds - Use a two-stage charge to punch a secondary round through the thickest armor.
Hellfire Rounds - Contain virulent bio-acidic toxins that can reduce targets to ash. -->
