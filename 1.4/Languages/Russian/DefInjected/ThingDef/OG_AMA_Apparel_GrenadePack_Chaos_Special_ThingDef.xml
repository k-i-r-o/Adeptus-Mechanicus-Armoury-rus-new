<OGI_GrenadePack_Blight.description>A Blight Grenade is a potent and dangerous radioactive anti-personnel weapon used by the military forces of the Imperium of Man.\n\nRad Grenades detonate in a shower of tiny, radioactively-contaminated fragments. Each fragment's ionising radioactive emissions have only a millisecond half-life, ensuring that the wielder can charge in without exposing themself to radioactive contamination.</OGI_GrenadePack_Blight.description>
