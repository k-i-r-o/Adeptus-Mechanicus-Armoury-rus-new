As a pistol-sized Pulse Weapon, it is only used by certain Tau personnel as a basic defence and hold-out weapon for use in desperate situations.

Pulse Pistols are most commonly issued to Sniper Drone Team Firesight Marksmen, although Tau Commanders who utilise a Tau Battlesuit Ejection System are also issued Pulse Pistols to aid them in making their way to safety if their Battlesuit has been destroyed.

Tau Air Caste pilots utilise a Pulse Pistol as a common sidearm, and Escort Drones are armed with twin Pulse Pistols to help protect their Water Caste master if necessary. -->
