A spinefist's lethally poisonous spines are coated with neuro-toxins which assault the nervous system of its victims, and are fired by a sharp exhalation of the host. Thus, a larger and more powerful host can exhale more spines in each salvo, ripping through the flesh of any caught victims. -->

These beetles are kept in their mature state in a hormone-induced dormancy until the weapon is ready to be fired. At this point, neural impulses from the wielder forces one of the insects into a firing sphincter. From here, the beetle can be fired at a target by a further impulse. -->
