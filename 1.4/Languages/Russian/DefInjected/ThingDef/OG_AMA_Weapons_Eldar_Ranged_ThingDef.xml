The Bright Lance is a far more efficient weapon than its cruder, human-made counterpart, in part due to its use of psychically-grown crystals to serve as a lasing matrix. It also possesses greater accuracy than a Lascannon and can penetrate any form of armour that is less than a certain thickness.</OGE_Gun_Brightlance.description>
